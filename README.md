GROUP NUMBER 43
MEMBERS MANELISI NGCOBO AND AYANDA MADLALA

Description//
This project is for the development and design of a MicroMouse for EEE3088F 2025. The Micro Mouse contains a Sensing Module, Power Module, as well as the main control unit(Motherboard). The sensing system will sense obstacles in the proximity of the mouse, while the power module is mainly for powering the motors of the mouse and charging the on-board battery of the mouse.

Structure//
//PCB: The KiCAD Project, Schematics & Layout and Project Libraries
//Firmware: Any software developed for the hardware or instructions on where to find relevant sofware
//Documents:â€ŠProject documentation and component datasheets
//Production: The gerber files, BOM, Budget, or anything required by the fabrication houses
//Simulation: Any simulation files (eg SPICE) or design stage generated results (E.g matlab or excel)

Usage
The project documentation can be found in the Documents directory and the files required to produce the PCB can be found in the Production directory.
